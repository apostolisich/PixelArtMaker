The final project (Pixel Art Maker) from the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship in which I got selected. 

The user inputs the dimensions (Height and Width) of a pixel canvas and clicks create. Then the user picks a color and starts drawing. 
By clicking the left mouse button or keeping it pressed, the user can draw a cell. When the user keeps the Shift button pressed and 
drags the left mouse button they can erase the color of a colored cell. There two addition buttons right above the canvas. The first
one clears the canvas and the second one fills the canvas with the selected color.

The project can be viewed here: https://tolisich.github.io/
